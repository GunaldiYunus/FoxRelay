						<h3>Expedited deliveries</h3>
						<p>Today’s consumers demand quicker delivery, including same-day and two-day services, yet only 25% are willing to pay a substantial difference to get their packages quicker. Depending on the time of year, multiple other factors make this shortened timeline difficult to meet with every single package. Fox Relay simplifies the process and reduces carriers’ need for additional staffing, thus dramatically reducing cost. Packages make it to consumers as expected, when expected.</p>
						<h3>Failed deliveries</h3>
						<p>Nearly 1 in 5 deliveries fail the first time, resulting in huge financial losses for carriers and a direct decrease in customer satisfaction. The truth is, a standard 9 to 5 delivery window no longer works for today’s consumers, but restructuring to meet these expectations proves undeniably costly. Fox Relay makes sure packages get to consumers no matter how many tries it takes, reducing the financial and manpower costs for carriers and mitigating the financial loss associated with failed deliveries.</p>
						<h3>Off-hour deliveries</h3>
						<p>Staffing 24-hour drivers isn’t cost effective, yet consumers want more from carriers than bank-hour delivery schedules. With Fox Relay, packages are delivered as requested, even off-hours, streamlining same- and second-day delivery services and specialty orders, and satisfying consumers’ “need it now” mentality. All for a fraction of what it would cost to handle that final mile on your own.</p>
						<h3>Oversized deliveries</h3>
						<p>Your drivers are on a tight schedule, and even one oversized package can throw off their entire day. Fox Relay reduces driver stress, resolves scheduling issues, and minimizes the associated costs. And our experienced, professional team provides the same level of respectful, proactive care you expect from your drivers.</p>
						<h3>One-off deliveries</h3>
						<p>We go beyond standard last mile delivery solutions to provide the resourcefulness you need to complete the shipping cycle. There are always special circumstances, whether it’s unique delivery requests and requirements or a problem that crops up before the package is in the consumer’s hand. Our team works with you to solve these cases with dedication, professionalism, and creative thinking.</p>
						<h3>Effortless tracking</h3>
						<p>Using a last mile delivery service should never complicate your tracking system and solutions. Fox Relay utilizes and integrates into your existing system so consumers still receive the same level of information, all with the same tracking code, from order to product in hand.</p>
